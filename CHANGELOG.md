# **Changelog**

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## **2.0.0 - 2025-07-08**

### **ðŸ’¥ Breaking Changes**

* **Synchronous API**: The plugin's core methods are now synchronous to improve performance. This affects how you create, use, and dispose of the plugin.  
  * `HandLandmarkerPlugin.create()` no longer returns a Future.  
  * `HandLandmarkerPlugin.dispose()` is now synchronous.  
  * The `detect()` method is now a synchronous, blocking call. You must manage how frequently you call it to avoid blocking the UI thread.

### **âœ¨ Features & Performance**

* **Native Image Processing (BREAKING)**: Rearchitected the plugin to perform all YUV image conversion natively in Kotlin. This eliminates the Dart background isolate and significantly reduces data transfer overhead for much lower latency.

* **GPU Acceleration**: Enabled the MediaPipe GPU delegate by default to accelerate model inference, resulting in smoother real-time performance. ([4749d8c
